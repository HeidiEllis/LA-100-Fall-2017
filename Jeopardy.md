## Jeopardy Assignment
## LA-100

**Introduction:** Jeopardy is reported to be America's favorite game show. It was created by Merv Griffin in 1964.  
The show uses a quiz format where contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers and must create a 
question that corresponds with the answer.  The Jeopardy board contains five columns and six rows of increasingly 
difficult clues as shown below:

The game is played in three rounds with the host reading the questions and three contestants vying to state 
the question that corresponds to the answer. 
Assignment: As a class, we will play only the initial round of three different games of jeopardy on three 
different days.  Each jeopardy board will contain either 4 or 5 columns and five rows.  Each column will 
represent a student topic related to open source.  In order to fulfill the rubrics for Oral Communication, we 
will modify how the game is played as follows:
1. We will play columns from left to right. 
2. We will play each column from top to bottom.
3. The student responsible for the column will present a 3 minute introduction to the topic:
.1. Topic title
.2. Brief introduction to the topic - what is it?
.3. Brief discussion of why the topic is important 
.4. Discussion of the bounds of the topic. In other words, describe what is and isn't included in the topic.
4. The student will create five answers and corresponding questions. Each will have:
.1. An answer that provides some interesting fact or observation about the topic.
.2. A question that clearly defines the answer. 
.3. A one minute further explanation of the topic. 
5. The five "answers" will be logically connected in some fashion. This connected by a sequence in time, 
by location, or other logical connection. 
6. A 2 minute conclusion of the topic. 

The game will start with the first topic where the student will introduce the first topic, read each answer for 
that topic, call on an audience member to respond to each, and then present the conclusion. Audience participation 
is encouraged and the instructor and FSAs will note such participation. 

**Deliverable:** You must hand in your notes that cover:
* Introduction
* Five answers and questions with a brief explanation as to how they are logically connected
* Conclusion

Note that you will be assessed based on the WNE Oral Communication Rubrics: https://www1.wne.edu/academic-affairs/assessment/doc/competencies-and-rubrics/oral-communication.pdf
